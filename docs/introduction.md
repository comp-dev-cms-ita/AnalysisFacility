# Long story short

The leading concept of this work is to create a pool of distributed resources for data analysis
that can be used transparently by the end-users.

Those resources have to be managed dinamically, depending on the current workflows. Moreover,
the end-users have a single front-end to access the analysis resource pool.

The current work in progress testbed is reachable with the following link:
